Shell Plugins
-------------

These plugins work behind the scenes making sure the basic commands Ansible runs,
in order to be able to execute a task's action,
are properly formated to work with the target machine.

You normally don't have to wory about these plugins at all,
unless you have a restricted or exotic setup,
in which the default ``/bin/sh`` is not a POSIX compatible shell or not availble for execution.

Enabling Shell Plugins
++++++++++++++++++++++

You probably never need to do this, but aside from the defaul configuration settings in :doc:`../config`,
you can use a 'connection variable' :ref:`ansible_shell_type` to select the plugin to use,
you will also want to update the :ref:`ansible_executable` to match.
